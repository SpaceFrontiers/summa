//! Broker metric names.
//!
//! Naming follows docs/metrics.md conventions: seconds histograms, `_total`
//! counters, and an `index` label wherever a request is index-scoped. Every
//! fallback path the broker can take (ambiguous routing, stale-topology
//! serving, admission rejection, write refusal) has a counter so it is
//! observable rather than silent.
