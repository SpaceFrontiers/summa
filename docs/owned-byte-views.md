# Owned byte views

## Current behavior

`directories::OwnedBytes` retains an `Arc<Vec<u8>>` or `Arc<Mmap>` and a
`NonNull<[u8]>` view validated at construction and slicing. Posting/position
readers, norms, fast fields and dictionaries share this owner; filesystem,
memory and HTTP directories construct it. Native mmap support is feature-gated;
the Vec owner also serves portable/WASM code. No persisted or wire format
includes this Rust struct.

The direct view occupies 32 bytes in native and portable builds. The query-local
owner variant keeps the native size unchanged and raises the portable size from
24 to 32 bytes. Subsequent `as_slice`
reads its pointer/length without resolving the backing enum, following the Arc
or checking the same range again. The backing owner and mmap classification
remain intact; no resident payload copy is added. A bounded expansion creates
one local owner allocation shared by its posting views.
The [ownedbytes implementation](https://docs.rs/ownedbytes/latest/src/ownedbytes/lib.rs.html)
used in Tantivy illustrates the same direct-view ownership principle.

Matched screens supported retaining the change. The complete selected reader's
latency and residency are reported in the [block-execution results](search-block-execution.md);
individual stage gains must not be multiplied. The owner passes native heap,
mmap, cross-thread lifetime tests and three strict-provenance Miri tests on an
isolated extraction of the actual implementation.

## Invariants and safety argument

### Query-local expansion owners

Concurrent prefix top-k costs about 4.86 ms of server CPU per request on the
large corpus, versus about 0.15 ms of native search for one representative
prefix. A concurrent profile identified shared reference-count contention during
posting construction and destruction. A bounded posting
expansion receives one local Arc owner over the same immutable storage. Its subviews
clone that local owner rather than repeatedly changing the file's shared
reference count. No payload is copied, read eagerly, pinned or cached.
Lazy file handles retain their range reader. Owner indirection is at most one
level; mmap classification, checked subranges and cross-thread lifetimes must
remain unchanged. Paired concurrent measurements improved prefix top-k
throughput from about 5,800 to 16,000–18,000 queries/second, reduced CPU/request
from about 4.85 ms to 1.5–1.65 ms, and reduced anonymous RSS from 203 to
187–190 MiB. Later removal of contention on the shared integrity observer is
measured separately in the closing-gap report. The observer still publishes
the first corruption to the original segment-wide write-once state.

- Every stored pointer/length comes from a checked slice of the owned allocation.
  A child slice is bounded by its parent view, including empty and nested views.
- Both backing allocations are stable while their Arc exists. Moving or cloning
  `OwnedBytes` moves/clones the handle, without moving the Vec buffer or mapping.
- OwnedBytes exposes immutable slices only. Its private Arc<Vec> is never mutated
  or returned; an external Arc clone cannot obtain unique mutable access while
  the view retains another strong reference. Mmaps retain the existing immutable
  mapping contract.
- Every clone retains the backing Arc. Dropping a parent, external Arc, file
  handle or sibling cannot release storage still used by a surviving view.
- `as_slice` returns a lifetime tied to `&self`; it cannot expose an independent
  static reference. Dereferencing the stored view is the sole unsafe read.
- Send/Sync follow from the immutable, stable storage and the Send/Sync owners.
  Document these conditions beside explicit implementations for the raw view.
- Mmap-only advice and locking still inspect the backing owner. Heap data must
  never enter mmap advice, and a view does not introduce residency or pinning.

Construction and slicing reject invalid ranges immediately. The old range-only
implementation could let a nested slice escape its parent while still remaining
inside the original allocation; the regression first demonstrated that boundary failure.
Tests cover dropped owners, cross-thread clones, empty views, unaligned
subviews, invalid/reversed ranges and mmap ownership. The search harness,
native-without-sync and portable compilation pass, along with whole-fixture
score/count and immutable-byte comparisons. Portable release builds and JavaScript tests are recorded in the performance review.

### Recyclable native backing

The native recyclable variant retains an Arc over an initialized vector plus a
weak reference to its bounded pool. The vector cannot be mutated while any view
exists. Its final owner returns the allocation (or frees it if the pool stopped).
Empty slices, local owners and cross-thread clones retain the same lifetime.
The variant is heap-backed and must never receive mmap advice. Pool return does
not hold file descriptors, service owners or byte-admission permits.
