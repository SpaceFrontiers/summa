# Merge-Time BP Reordering

Status: implemented for BMP; extended to mapped text on September 17, 2026.

## Problem

Recursive Graph Bisection (BP) reordering was originally a standalone,
whole-segment operation: merges block-copy BMP data in concatenated source
order, and a separate pass (`summa-tool reorder` / the server's background
optimizer) later rewrites the entire segment — copying every unchanged file
and rebuilding the sparse file. For a freshly merged segment the index is
rewritten **twice**: once by the merge, once by the reorder.

That makes ordering quality arrive in one large, deferred, IO-heavy step
instead of amortizing over the index's natural rewrite cycle.

## Design

Run BP _inside_ the merge, where the output sparse file is being written
anyway:

- Index-level SDL option, persisted in the schema at creation:

  ```sdl
  index articles {
      reorder_on_merge: true
      field splade: sparse_vector<...> [indexed, reorder]
  }
  ```

  Absent = disabled — merges block-copy exactly as before (the default
  preserves current behaviour). Programmatic:
  `SchemaBuilder::set_reorder_on_merge(true)`. Setting the option with no
  `reorder`-attributed field warns loudly at parse time (it would do
  nothing).

- Per-field gate: only text and BMP sparse fields carrying the `reorder` schema attribute
  (`field splade: sparse_vector<...> [indexed, reorder]`,
  `SchemaBuilder::set_reorder`) are BP-reordered — by merges AND by the
  standalone reorder paths (`summa-tool reorder`, `IndexWriter::reorder`,
  the server's background optimizer). Fields without the attribute have
  their blob copied byte-identically (insertion order preserved — right for
  corpora whose insertion order already clusters well, e.g. date-sorted).
  Skips are logged loudly. Note this tightened an old behavior: standalone
  reorder used to BP every BMP field regardless of the attribute.
- When enabled, `merge_sparse_vectors` replaces the byte-level block-copy of
  BMP fields with: build a multi-source forward index from the source
  `BmpIndex`es → run BP (`graph_bisection`, same parameters as standalone
  reorder) → write the merged blob in permuted order. Doc-id maps are patched
  with per-source offsets during the write.
- The merged segment is marked `reordered: true` in metadata, so the
  background optimizer skips it — eliminating the second whole-segment
  rewrite.
- Text fields use the shared text planner over source physical IDs and the
  existing bounded posting/position writer. CHNK output applies the permutation
  while streaming source columns; it translates logical slots through the same
  inverse map. Legacy plain inputs with stored lengths use the existing identity
  migration. Missing lengths with nonzero tokens fail explicitly.
- Text and BMP convergence jointly determine the replacement metadata. Other
  fields and segment files keep the normal copy/merge path. No intermediate
  complete segment is written and reopened for reordering.

Amortization property: the tiered merge cascade rewrites small segments often
and large segments rarely, so BP cost is paid in proportion to (and at the
same moment as) IO the merge already spends. BP also warm-starts implicitly —
`graph_bisection` refines from the input order, and merge inputs are usually
already BP-ordered, so convergence at merge time is fast.

## Interior-padding correctness (bug fixed alongside)

Fresh BMP segments pad only the tail of the doc map (`u32::MAX` slots after
`num_real_docs`). Block-copy merges concatenate sources _including_ each
source's tail padding, producing merged segments whose real docs are **not**
contiguous in vid space. The standalone reorder and BP forward-index builder
assumed `vid < num_real_docs` ⇔ real doc — on such segments this silently
dropped real docs shifted past `num_real_docs` (their postings and doc-map
entries vanished from the reordered blob) and treated interior padding slots
as empty docs.

Fix: both the forward-index builder and the reorder blob writer now derive
realness from the doc map itself (`doc_map_ids[vid] != u32::MAX`) via
per-source real↔virtual mappings. This is pinned by
`test_bmp_reorder_after_merge_keeps_interior_padded_docs`. A side benefit:
any BP rewrite (merge-time or standalone) compacts interior padding, so the
output always has tail-only padding.

## Cost

- Extra merge CPU: forward-index build + BP, and explicit text re-encoding.
  Text planning shares the BMP frequency/budget selection helpers and k-way term
  traversal with ordinary posting merge. Bounded by the same
  `memory_budget` df-dropping as standalone reorder (24 GB default). BMP runs
  in `spawn_blocking`; text uses the existing multithread-runtime blocking
  boundary. Rayon parallelism uses the process-wide background pool. The
  server's `--optimizer-concurrent-passes` gate covers this path too,
  so merge-time and standalone passes cannot multiply without bound.
- Text rewriting retains bounded permutation records and source position
  directories. Map migration follows term writing; text plans and its scheduler
  permit are dropped before BMP work. Budget exhaustion and cancellation fail
  through the existing output claim owner.
- Saved: one full segment rewrite per merge (the optimizer pass), including
  its read traffic against the page cache.
- Merge wall-clock grows; for latency-sensitive ingest keep the flag off and
  rely on the background optimizer as before.

## Future (not implemented)

- Debt-driven scheduling: prioritize standalone reorder by observed
  `blocks_scored/blocks_total` pruning ratio per segment.
- Routed placement: order small-segment docs by superblock term-mass
  signatures of the largest segment before merging.

## Row visibility and explicit compaction

Ordinary merges retain tombstones. `ForceMergeRequest.compact` is independent of
`reorder_on_merge`: when true, the normal merge hierarchy (including configured
BP) completes, then each final dirty output is compacted once. Compaction stably
filters the current physical and per-field BMP orders; it does not run BP or
retrain ANN structures. It preserves `reordered` and the BP attempt counter, but
clears convergence for a surviving, previously reordered BMP layout because
filtering changes block membership. See [row deletion](row-deletion.md).

## Standalone binary ANN coalescing

Standalone reorder also joins fragmented binary IVF/ScaNN runs by cluster, using
the existing encoded-run compactor and exact-location writer. This requires no
`reorder` field attribute and works on binary-only indexes. It preserves exact
codes, ordinals, logical IDs, and global training artifacts. It uses the same
output ownership, cancellation, memory budget, and publication as text/BMP
reorder; already contiguous vector files are linked/copied unchanged.

This work is deliberately outside merge-time BP: ordinary binary merges always
copy ANN payloads and exact lookup rows, even when `reorder_on_merge` is enabled.
Cluster coalescing rewrites labels and sorts lookup metadata, so it belongs in
the separate maintenance pass. See [binary vector storage](binary-vector-storage.md).
