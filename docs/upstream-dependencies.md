# Upstream dependency pins

Cargo dependencies use official repository URLs, with no personal-fork
URLs. The tokenizer contains an explicitly maintained source extraction; see
[its upstream provenance](../summa-tokenizer/UPSTREAM.md). GPU fixes that have not yet merged are fetched from their official
repositories at the immutable heads of the corresponding upstream pull
requests.

The Apache Arrow [`object_store`](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs-object-store/commit/c7316d29face118e7409eead0cda098f38589428)
revision `c7316d29face118e7409eead0cda098f38589428` is an official-repository
security-fix pin. It can return to crates.io after a release containing the
pinned `quick-xml` update is available.

## Update procedure

1. Verify the linked upstream submissions and their exact head revisions.
2. Advance only to commits reachable from the official repository URL; never
   add a Cargo patch or dependency URL for a contributor repository.
3. Run the host test, lint, documentation, and CUDA-feature build gates, then
   run CUDA parity and steady-state throughput evidence before promotion.
4. Replace Git revisions with released versions once all required changes are
   available upstream.
