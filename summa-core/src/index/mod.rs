//! Index - multi-segment async search index
//!
//! The `Index` is the central concept that provides:
//! - `Index::create()` / `Index::open()` - create or open an index
//! - `index.writer()` - get an IndexWriter for adding documents
//! - `index.reader()` - get an IndexReader for searching (with reload policy)
//!
//! The Index owns the SegmentManager which handles segment lifecycle and tracking.
