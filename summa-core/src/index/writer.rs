//! IndexWriter — async document indexing with parallel segment building.
//!
//! This module is only compiled with the "native" feature.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! ```text
//! add_document() ──try_send──► [shared bounded MPMC] ◄──recv── worker 0
//!                                                     ◄──recv── worker 1
//!                                                     ◄──recv── worker N
//! ```
//!
//! - **Shared MPMC queue** (`async_channel`): all workers compete for documents.
//!   Busy workers (building segments) naturally stop pulling; free workers pick up slack.
//! - **Zero-copy pipeline**: `Document` is moved (never cloned) through every stage:
//!   `add_document()` → channel → `recv_blocking()` → `SegmentBuilder::add_document()`.
//! - `add_document` returns `QueueFull` when the queue is at capacity.
//! - **Workers are OS threads**: CPU-intensive work (tokenization, posting list building)
//!   runs on dedicated threads, never blocking the tokio async runtime.
//!   Async I/O (segment file writes) is bridged via `Handle::block_on()`.
//! - **Fixed per-worker memory budget**: `max_indexing_memory_bytes / num_workers`.
//!   Workers use deterministic, staggered soft flush thresholds within that
//!   budget so equal-size builders do not all stop draining at once.
//! - **Build concurrency reserve**: while input is open, at most `N - 1`
//!   workers build segments concurrently. A worker that cannot get a slot
//!   keeps draining up to the former 80% flush boundary. Once input closes,
//!   all `N` tail builds may finish concurrently because no drainer is needed.
//! - **Two-phase commit**:
//!   1. `prepare_commit()` — closes queue, workers flush builders to disk.
//!      Returns a `PreparedCommit` guard. No new documents accepted until resolved.
//!   2. `PreparedCommit::commit()` — registers segments in metadata, resumes workers.
//!   3. `PreparedCommit::abort()` — discards prepared segments, resumes workers.
//!   4. `commit()` — convenience: `prepare_commit().await?.commit().await`.
//!
//! Since `prepare_commit`/`commit` take `&mut self`, Rust’s borrow checker
//! guarantees no concurrent `add_document` calls during the commit window.
